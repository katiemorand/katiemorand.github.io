<h1>Cutest Animals Across the World</h1>

<h2> Explination </h2>
<p>I love animals. How could anyone not? They're so cute and so fun to play with. If I had the 
room and money to house all of the animals in the worls, I would. I tried to think of the top ten 
cutest animals to me and then I rated them on a scale of one to ten. One was the lowest and ten was 
the highest. I tried to use each number once, so I could rank them and put them in an order.
</p>
<p>I truly think that all animals are cute, but not every animal can be the cutest. That is why I 
creaed this chart. I hope it will give light to my opinions on some of the cutest animals. This was 
very hard for me to do because I, personlly, think every snimal is cute. It was hard for me to first
pick the top ten cutest animals in my opinion, but then I had to rank them and choose my absolute
favorite. There are some animals that I would consdier equally cute, but I thought hard and picked one 
over the other.
